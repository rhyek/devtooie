/**
 * Whether devtooie was started by a coding agent rather than by a person at a keyboard.

 * Agents run shell commands through a non-interactive child shell, and every mainstream
 * one marks that shell with an environment variable — the same trick `CI=true` plays. No
 * standard exists yet (the `AGENT` proposal is still open), so this is a list, not a rule.
 *
 * The check is **set and non-empty**, never a value match: the values are wildly
 * inconsistent (`CLAUDECODE=1`, `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt`, `AGENT=goose`), and a future
 * version changing its value shouldn't silently turn detection off.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded are variables an *editor* sets while a human drives the terminal —
 * `COPILOT_DEBUG_NONCE`, `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode`, and friends. They say "an AI tool is
 * installed", not "an agent is at the wheel", and a false positive here is the expensive
 * direction: it would let one agent's session auto-kill a *person's* running session, which
 * is the exact thing the takeover prompt exists to prevent.
