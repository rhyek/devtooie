/**
 * Mount the Ink TUI (`renderApp`) with React in its **production** build, without
 * forcing `NODE_ENV=production` on the dev processes devtooie spawns.
 *
 * Ink is built on React, and React (plus `react-reconciler`/`scheduler`) picks its
 * development-vs-production build exactly once — from `process.env.NODE_ENV`, the
 * instant its module is first evaluated. There is no runtime or constructor switch,
 * and React's maintainers explicitly declined to add one that bypasses `NODE_ENV`
 * (facebook/react#24984); the package `exports` even block importing the production
 * bundle directly. So `NODE_ENV` at import time is the only lever.
 *
 * This matters because React's *development* build (19.2+) emits a
 * `performance.measure()` per render for its DevTools "performance tracks". Node never
 * flushes the User-Timing timeline, so in a long-lived TUI — which re-renders on a
 * timer forever — those entries pile up without bound and eventually OOM the process
 * (facebook/react#34770). The production build emits none.
 *
 * We can't just set `NODE_ENV=production` process-wide: the child dev servers devtooie
 * launches must inherit whatever `NODE_ENV` the outer shell had. So pin `production`
 * for only the moment React's modules first evaluate — a dynamic `import()` while the
 * var is forced — then restore the previous value. React caches the production build
 * it loaded, so the restore can't flip it back, and everything spawned afterwards sees
 * the original environment.
 *
 * INVARIANT: nothing that transitively imports `ink`/`react` may be imported
 * *statically* on any path reachable from `cli.ts` before this runs. A static import
 * would evaluate React in development mode first — reinstating the leak — before we
 * ever get to pin `production`. (The type-only import above is erased at compile time
 * and never loads the module.) Today the entire Ink surface lives under
 * `src/components/*` and is reachable only through `./components/App.js`, which this
 * loads dynamically; keep it that way.
