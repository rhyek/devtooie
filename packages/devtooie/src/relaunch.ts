/**
 * Start a session over with a small young generation (`--max-semi-space-size`) unless it already
 * has one.
 *
 * V8 sizes its young generation by how fast a process allocates, up to 64 MB a semi-space, and
 * keeps the memory once it has it. A session allocates steadily (every frame of the TUI, every log
 * line), so it would hold well over a hundred megabytes of young generation for a few megabytes of
 * live objects. Capped at {@link SEMI_SPACE_MB}, a session's footprint stays near what it holds,
 * at the cost of more, and shorter, young-generation collections.
 *
 * V8 reads the flag only as the process starts, so setting it from here (`v8.setFlagsFromString`)
 * does nothing. Instead the process runs itself again with it: `process.execve` replaces the
 * program in place, keeping the pid and the terminal. Where there is no `execve` (Windows, Node.js
 * before 23.11), a session runs without the cap.
 *
 * Starting over costs a Node.js startup, some 40 ms, which is nothing to a session and a good part
 * of a one-off command's run, so only sessions do it. What this module records as it loads, before
 * `cli.ts`'s own code changes either, is the environment and working directory the process was
 * started with, and the process starts over from those.
