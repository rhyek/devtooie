/**
 * The toast rows, newest last, floating **over** the bottom of the log pane.
 *
 * The whole stack is `position: absolute`, so it is out of flow and costs no
 * height: the log pane keeps every row it had, and a toast simply paints over the
 * tail of the last few. `bottom: 100%` glues its bottom edge to the top edge of its
 * containing block — {@link BottomChrome}'s box — so it rides that edge for free:
 * when the jump-to-latest row appears the chrome grows and the stack moves up with
 * it, and back down when it goes. That is Yoga doing the work; nothing measures a
 * height to make it happen, and it must stay that way.
 *
 * `right: 0` with an auto width shrink-wraps each row against the right edge, where
 * log lines have usually run out, so the text they'd otherwise hide is minimal —
 * and nothing is painted but the glyphs themselves (no `backgroundColor`), so the
 * rest of the row shows through untouched.
 *
 * Toasts carry no glyph of their own; the tone sets the color and the caller's
 * message says what happened.
