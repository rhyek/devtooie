 *
 * The target row is the next one in that direction that has items, wrapping from the last row
 * to the first and back; with a single row the cursor stays put. Within it, the item whose left
 * edge is nearest the current one's, ties to the left — except that the **first item of each
 * row counts as starting where the rows start**, as if the `infra:` label in front of the
 * services were part of the first one. So the first service sits under the first package, and
 * every other item is measured where it is drawn.
