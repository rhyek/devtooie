/**
 * The signals that must end a dev session gracefully rather than killing devtooie outright.
 *
 * `SIGHUP` is the one that matters most, and the one that's easiest to miss. It's what a closing
 * terminal window, a killed tmux pane, or a dropped SSH connection delivers. With no handler Node
 * takes the default disposition and dies immediately: `process.on('exit')` does **not** run, so
 * `ProcessManager`'s exit hook never fires and nothing kills the packages. And because packages
 * are spawned `detached: true` — each in its own process group — the terminal's hangup never
 * reaches them either. Detaching, which is what lets devtooie kill a whole `pnpm → node → node`
 * tree by process group, also shields that tree from the hangup that killed its parent.
 *
 * The result is the entire subtree reparenting to PID 1, one fresh generation of orphans per
 * closed terminal, each still holding its file descriptors and recursive file watches.
 *
 * `SIGKILL` cannot be trapped, so it is deliberately absent here; that case is covered on the next
 * startup by the recorded-child sweep in `dev-session.ts`.
