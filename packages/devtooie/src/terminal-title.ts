 * Terminal window/tab title control for the fullscreen TUI.

 * processes freely emit their own OSC title-setting sequences — a shell echoing
 * the command it's about to run, a build tool announcing progress — and because
 * their output is *captured* and re-rendered into the log viewport (rather than
 * flowing straight to the terminal), those sequences would otherwise reach the
 * real terminal and make the tab flicker between whatever each child last set.
 * {@link stripTitleSequences} removes them from captured output so only our
 * title survives; {@link setTitleSequence} produces the one we write on mount.
