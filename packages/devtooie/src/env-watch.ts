 * target's `onChange` (debounced) when one of its files is created, edited, or removed — that is,
 * when what one of them reads as differs from the last time it fired (or from the start).
 * Watching directories — rather than the files themselves — means files that don't exist
 * yet are still picked up when they appear. Best-effort: a directory that can't be watched
 * (e.g. it doesn't exist) is skipped silently. Returns a disposer that stops every watcher, and
 * says when the watch is {@link EnvWatch.ready}.
 *
 * A watched name that is a symlink is also followed to the file it resolves to (through chains
 * and symlinked parent directories), whose directory is watched for that one basename: writing
 * through a link changes only its target, so the link's own directory never hears about it. The
 * resolution is redone whenever the target fires, which is how a link that is created, removed or
 * repointed moves its watch along.
 *
 * "Best-effort" has to cover failures that arrive *after* a successful `fs.watch()` call, not just
 * the synchronous throw. The OS can fail a watcher later — most commonly `EMFILE` on macOS, where
 * the FSEvents budget is machine-wide, so an unrelated project's watch-heavy dev stack can knock
 * this one over. An `FSWatcher` with no `error` listener makes that an unhandled `'error'` event,
 * which takes the whole devtooie process down and every package with it. Losing `.env`
 * live-reload for one directory is a much better outcome than losing the session.
